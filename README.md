Web components  Demo

Web components are the w3 standards to create the custom elements and think beyond the avilable HTML tags, to create your own 
custom elements. 

Web components are based on:
1) Custome elements
2) HTML Import
3) Templates
4) Shadow Demo

As of now Chrome and Opera are 100% supporting web components. For other browser you need to use polyfill webcomponents.js or
other library available such as polymer.
